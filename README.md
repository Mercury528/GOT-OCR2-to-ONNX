# Convert GOT-OCR2.safetensors to onnx


I found the weight is safetensors when i git GOT-OCR2_0 from modelscope.But in order to deploy to Ascend servers, the model needs to be onnx so that i can proceed to the next step.I only have achieved conversion and the parameters of each layer have been obtained but not a xxx.onnx at present.I will continue to try.

Step1：download got-ocr2
